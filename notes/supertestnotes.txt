Mocky
    - Usually, when testing APIs, there will be hitting a HTTP server, and the API will be hosted there
    - There is a site called Mocky which allows for testing purposes the setting up of a response
        - This will then generate a HTTP response

GET requests
    - GET requests have a couple of different parameters - route parameters and query parameters
    - Route Parameters
        - Route parameters come in the URL themselves
        - These can be an ID or a specific name of something being queried etc
        - Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL

    - Query Parameters
        - A query string is a part of a URL) that assigns values to specified parameters
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string
        - Query parameters are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url
            - They are extensions of the URL that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed
            - To append query params to the end of a URL, a ‘?’ Is added followed immediately by a query parameter
