Running Playwright tests
    - Default mode of running tests is headless
    - There will be more workers than tests as the tests will run in multiple browsers by default if not specified
        - This does not apply if only running console tests
    - Tests can be run on single or multiple browsers and with flags to generate screenshot on test failures
        - Run all tests across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit         --> npx folio 
        - Run tests on a single browser                             --> npx folio --param browserName=chromium
        - Run all tests in headful mode                             --> npx folio --param headful
        - Save screenshots on failure in test-results directory     --> npx folio --param screenshotOnFailure
        - Record Videos                                             --> npx folio --param video
        - To see all options available                              --> npx folio --help
    - The testrunner can be customised with Folio parameters
        - This can be done in the package.json test section 

Folio
    - A customisable test framework to build your own test frameworks
        - https://github.com/microsoft/folio
    - It is the foundation for the Playwright test runner
    - Folio is based on the concept of Test Fixtures
        - These are used to establish an environment for each test
        - The test is given all that it needs and nothing else

!! - Running Files
    - There maybe issues with Anti-Virus on first run of tests which may cause failures 
    - These should not be a problem on a second run
