        - Run all tests across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit --> npx folio 
        - Run tests on a single browser                     --> npx folio --param browserName=chromium

Folio
    - A customisable test framework to build your own test frameworks
        - https://github.com/microsoft/folio
    - It is the foundation for the Playwright test runner

!! - Running Files
    - There maybe issues with Anti-Virus on first run of tests which may cause failures 
    - These should not be a problem on a second run
