Intro To Contract Tests
    - https://docs.pact.io/

Contracts
    - Contracts can be thought of as a legally enforceable agreement
    - Contracts represent a set of interactions with expected requests and response structures
    - Often the term pact and contract can be used interchangably

What is a contract test 
    - A Contract Test verifies that a provider has fulfilled a contract expected by a consuming service and ensures that services can communicate with each other
    - Contract Tests are applicable anywhere where two services communicates with each other eg an API to a front-end 
    - Contract tests can have either a simple or complex structure
    - Often the provider of one flow can be the consumer of another, as is common in a microservices architecture

Providers and Consumers
    - Firstly what constitutes a provider and consumer
        - A provider is any party that provides a service for interactions with its dependents
        - A consumer is any party that interacts with a dependent service through an API

Broker
    - A broker is where contracts are stored
    - This can be any generic asset server but support for versioning is ideal
    - The pact-broker maybe a good solution as it is well-suited and is Open Source
