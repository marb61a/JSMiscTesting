Cucumber
    - BDD stands for behavior-driven development, and it's an example-based method for developing software
    - It includes many different collaborative activities and techniques performed by stakeholders, namely the product owner, the tester, and the developer
        - These are often referred to as the 3 amigos
    - One of the major activities is having the Three Amigos meet to discuss and document examples of how a system should act and be used
        - These examples describe how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement
        - These examples do not outline how a system, or its features should be implemented, only how it should behave
    - The end result of discussing and documenting these examples is that all parties should come to a mutual understanding of how the system should work
    - An important point to note is that BDD is not solely a testing technique
        - Like test-driven development, it's a process of approaching a design and forcing thinking about desired outcomes prior to coding 
    - The major goals of BDD are to narrow the communication gaps among team members
        - Foster a better understanding of the customer's needs
        - Promote continuous communication throughout the software development process
    - From the very beginning to the end BDD involves the collaboration of all team members to get an understanding of the needs of a system
    - This continuous collaboration has several benefits
        - The entire team is speaking the same domain language
        - Silos are being broken down
        - There is a much better shared understanding of what will need to be done
        - Examples that are generated from team meetings can as executable artifacts that drive test automation
    - An example is a description of how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement.
    - Gherkin is a special syntax that should be used when developing examples
        - It is designed in a way for anyone to understand the behavior of a feature

Gherkin
    - Gherkin is a special syntax that is used within BDD to document examples
    - Gherkin uses a set of special keywords to give structure and meaning to executable specifications
        - The files that are used to store Gherkin are referred to as feature files because each file is usually used to document the behavior for one feature
        - Each group of instructions that relate to the actions and behavior of an individual scenario of a feature is actually referred to as an example or a scenario
    - Some of the core keywords of Gherkin are: Feature, Scenario, Example, Given, When, and Then
    - In a standard layout each line starts with a keyword followed by some descriptive text
        - Start with the Feature keyword whose descriptive text outlines the feature, it's expected behavior, and how it relates to a business requirement
        - Then there is a Scenario keyword whose descriptive text outlines the specific business situation related to the feature
        - Following these then there is Given, When, and Then — the cornerstone of Gherkin scenarios
        - Each line in an example that begins with Given, When, or Then is called a Step
            - These are responsible for explaining the state of a system or linking an action and the expected behavior
    - Gherkin is written in English like statements making it easy for anyone to understand
    - Some of the keywords and usage are
        - Given —> used to outline some preconditions that are necessary for this scenario to be executed by a user
        - When —> used to describe the action to be performed
        - Then —> used to describe the outcome from the action
        - And or But —> these can be used to duplicate any previous keyword
        - Using And, and But can make a scenario easier to read
    - Scenario Outline — this is useful when you want to run the same scenario with different values
        - It is used in conjunction with the Examples keyword
    - Examples — also referred to as data tables, are used to outline the values to be used within a Scenario Outline
        - These are represented in a table format
