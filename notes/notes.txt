Cucumber
    - BDD stands for behavior-driven development, and it's an example-based method for developing software
    - It includes many different collaborative activities and techniques performed by stakeholders, namely the product owner, the tester, and the developer
        - These are often referred to as the 3 amigos
    - One of the major activities is having the Three Amigos meet to discuss and document examples of how a system should act and be used
        - These examples describe how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement
        - These examples do not outline how a system, or its features should be implemented, only how it should behave
    - The end result of discussing and documenting these examples is that all parties should come to a mutual understanding of how the system should work
    - An important point to note is that BDD is not solely a testing technique
        - Like test-driven development, it's a process of approaching a design and forcing thinking about desired outcomes prior to coding 
    - The major goals of BDD are to narrow the communication gaps among team members
        - Foster a better understanding of the customer's needs
        - Promote continuous communication throughout the software development process
    - From the very beginning to the end BDD involves the collaboration of all team members to get an understanding of the needs of a system
    - This continuous collaboration has several benefits
        - The entire team is speaking the same domain language
        - Silos are being broken down
        - There is a much better shared understanding of what will need to be done
        - Examples that are generated from team meetings can as executable artifacts that drive test automation
    - An example is a description of how the software is intended to behave, often illustrating a particular business rule or requirement.
    - Gherkin is a special syntax that should be used when developing examples
        - It is designed in a way for anyone to understand the behavior of a feature
